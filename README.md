Advent of Code
==============

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

I am sharing my source in case any one interested to the solution written by Java.
I also adapting the functional way to solving the question.
