# Solutions to [Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) in Java

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

I am sharing my sources which are written in Java 10-17 to anyone who is interested.

Some coding considerations:

  * prefer readability (clean code) more than performance 
  * adapting new language features in the latest Java version
  * including unit test cases in most of the solutions

## How to get the answer

Put your input inside java source file or correspondent text file. Then, running the java class as Java Application. The result will be printed to the console logs.
